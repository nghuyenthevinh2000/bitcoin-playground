# Philosophy of bitcoin scripts 

## Signature 
- [elliptic curve](cryptography/elliptic-curve.md): Math behind the signature 
- [ECDSA](cryptography/ecdsa.md): ECDSA algorithm, standard signing algorithm for bitcoin 
- [Schnorr](cryptography/schnorr.md): Schnorr algorithm, an upgrade to ECDSA 
- [Multi-signature](bitcoin-signature-scheme/mutli-signature.md): Multi-signature scheme 
- [Frost](bitcoin-signature-scheme/frost.md): Multi-signature scheme with threshold 


# TODO 

- [ ] Tool to aumatically document this 
- [ ] Add scripts to simulate the algorithms
