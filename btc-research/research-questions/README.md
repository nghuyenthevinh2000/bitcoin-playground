BitVM is optimistic roll-ups, fraud can be challenged with proofs, with security assumption of at least one honest node. 
* If challenged successfully, user Bitcoin will be returned to them
* If no honest node, user Bitcoin will remain locked. However, this would expose users to hostage where they have to agree to give out BTC or they are fucked.
